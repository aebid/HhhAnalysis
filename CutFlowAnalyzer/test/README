1.- List of files for each sample in python directory:


2.- Put the list of MC samples in a text file  (i.e.  mc.txt)


3.- Create the SBATCH jobs 
    ./create_sbatch_mcreco.sh  mc.txt

4.- Go to SBATCH_JOBS directory and submit the the jobs


    sbatch job.slrm
5.- Check the status of the jobs:

    squeue -u username

6.- Once the jobs finish merge the output file for each sample.
    
    ./tar.sh mc.txt
    

    
Instrcutions to run DiHiggsWWBBAnalyzer.cc
this analyzer is targeted to run on DiHiggs, TTbar, DY samples
Sampletype is used to mark which sample it is running on 
if you are using data, set Sampletype=0 and analyzer will skip gen-level selection 
if you are using signal sample, e.g. B6, you can set Sampletype=0, or Sampletype=6 which will check gen-level information
if you are using TTbar, you can set Sampletype=0, or Sampletype=13 which will check gen-level information
if you are using DY sample, you can set Sampletype=0, or Sampletype=14 which will check gen-level information( not implemented yet)

The event will be saved only if it pass preselection at reco levle but we also sometimes keep track of gen-level information
