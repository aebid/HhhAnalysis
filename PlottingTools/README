# Make the plots:
1) Adjust "PlotterProducer.py" with the correct input files:
  a) in HhhAnalysis/CutFlowAnalyzer/test/DATA_MINIAODtoNtuple you have a file called multicrab3.py
  b) in 'multicrab3.py' set OnlySubmitCRAB to False
  c) "python multicrab3.py" will create a file called 'for_plotter.py'
  d) copy the content of for_plotter.py in PlotterProducer.py (under # Data)
  e) Redo these steps for the file "multicrab3.py" in HhhAnalysis/CutFlowAnalyzer/test/MC_MINIAODtoNtuple 
2) source Send_PlotterProducer.sh
3) Once the jobs are done Make the Stack plots running
